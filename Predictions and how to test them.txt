🔭 Predictions & How to Test Them
1. Antimatter Weight in 8D
Prediction: Doubling spacetime to 8D balances matter–antimatter “weight” and accounts for missing galactic mass without exotic particles.

Method: Derive the antiverse’s effective density/pressure in our 4D slice from the geometry.

Data: CMB (Planck/ACT), BAO, SN Ia, weak lensing.

Pass: Fits distances and structure growth as well as ΛCDM with no extra free parameters.

Fail: Fits one but not the other, or requires fine‑tuning.

2. Dark Matter as Geometric Energy
Prediction: “Dark matter” is energy stored in tetrahedral FCC‑like cells, scaling naturally with baryons.

Method: Predict halo profiles and Tully–Fisher zero‑point from geometry.

Data: SPARC rotation curves, lensing maps, cluster mass profiles.

Pass: Matches dwarf cores and cluster lensing with one mechanism.

Fail: Needs per‑galaxy tuning.

3. Neutrino CP Symmetry from 8D
Prediction: Universe–antiverse parity link fixes δ_CP, mass ordering, and Dirac/Majorana nature.

Method: Map parity constraint to PMNS matrix; predict 0νββ effective mass.

Data: T2K, NOvA, DUNE, Hyper‑K, KamLAND‑Zen, LEGEND.

Pass: δ_CP/mass ordering/0νββ match predicted narrow range.

Fail: Any are excluded by current bounds.

4. Dark Energy from Sphere “Swelling”
Prediction: Cosmic acceleration emerges from entropy‑driven sphere volume increase.

Method: Derive w(a) from micro‑swelling law; compare to w0–wa constraints.

Data: SN Ia (Pantheon+), BAO, CMB distances.

Pass: w(a) within current contours, with a distinctive wa sign/magnitude.

Fail: Requires tuning to avoid tension.

5. FCC Microstructure Imprint
Prediction: FCC/tetrahedral microstructure leaves a scale‑dependent signature in matter power spectrum and void stats.

Method: Compute feature scale from cell geometry; compare to observed suppression/features.

Data: Lyman‑α forest, galaxy clustering P(k), void size function.

Pass: One natural scale matches data.

Fail: No match without tuning.
