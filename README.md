So, are you ready for a Theory of Everything???
Well, too bad, you have to have CCC of Roger Penrose too, and I don't have it, but together they make a ToE :-)









So, A little about me,
My name is Flor Hoorebeke, i'm 50, dropped out of school before I had the chance to learn more about cosinus, sinus, tangent, ...
I've been depressed for about 25 years now, and 15 of which I grew mildly agoraphobic and locked myself up in my own room for 22
hours a day. I wasn't really feeling sorry for myself, i'm quite comfortable with solitude, but it's the lack of companionship
that is the hardest sometimes, somebody to talk to, because that is what people won't do, talk to me, i'm always the one that has to start
except for one person, a friend of mine, he just won't shut up.
But, I was smart, I educated myself some physics and invention a lot of cool stuff, waiting to become a reality, like a new hyperloop design,
a global array of radio telescopes 50km high, a new type of aerogel, a new type of construction material from waste, etc...
So physics, I just left theories left and right of me, I don't understand the math behind it anyway, that I still have to learn, starting with
cos,sin, tan, functions, operators, integrals, differentials, calculus (which is the last 2) , and my own tetrahedral math! But, I did
try to obey every single physics law, heisenberg, pauli, conservation laws, everything of physics that is edged in stone to say it blunt.

From that I just used my intuition and own logics, and now I wrote this:

Basically it says that 

- Spacetime is 8 dimensional, not 4 dimensional
- When doubling dimensions accounting for weight in antimatter it solves for the weight problem in galaxies and the matter-vs-antimatter problem
- Inflation is the LAST symmetry breaking of spacetime
- The higgs, Dark matter and Dark energy are all mechanisms, and the higgs is also the geometry itself mimicking a bosonic state
- IF/When proven will also prove General Relavitity Theorem as well as Quantum Mechanics into theorem
- It complements Sir/Professor Penrose's cyclic conformal cosmology, he has the initial conditions I reconcile General relativity and Quantum mechanics
- is only based on theorems and own logics.
- etc..

The Einzweiterstein conjecture also contains Tetrahedral Mathematics, a new type of math to calculate with dimensions easily.
The P vs NP suggestion, were questions asked to GPT 5, and this is the result. It involved the making of a new logic gate, 
a symmetric logic gate with 4 inputs and 4 outputs, this together with the golay code and maryna viazovska's leech lattice 
(they fit beautifully), we might have a chance in solving p vs np

enjoy :)
