The Einzweiterstein conjecture also contains Tetrahedral Mathematics, a new type of math to calculate with dimensions easily.
The P vs NP suggestion, were questions asked to GPT 5, and this is the result. It involved the making of a new logic gate, 
a symmetric logic gate with 4 inputs and 4 outputs, this together with the golay code and maryna viazovska's leech lattice 
(they fit beautifully), we might have a chance in solving p vs np

enjoy :)
